Servant is an example web service with protected endpoints using
package [gregoryv/htsec](https://github.com/gregoryv/htsec).

The purpose is not to provide a complete easy to install service
rather to illustrate the implementation required.

Read the code!

The service runs as a systemd service but is hardcoded to run smoothly
on my computer. 

If it's running you can access it on http://servant.7de.se:8100/.
